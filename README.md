April 9th 2020::

This small C++ game was started on April the 7th 2020. I am following a Udemy course (aobut 3 hours so far) in an effort to learn about C++, primarily for the current purpose of learning to use the Unreal Engine and explore game asset creation, modeling, animating, etc. (Essentially, I would like to be able to perform the "full stack" of game development). It is very ambitious, but the first step has been taken.

As such, the code present in this repository is NOT ENTIRELY of my origin. What this means is that though I am following along with the videos step-by-step and manually entering the code and debugging in order to maximize the educaitonal value, much of the core program is provided for learning purposes through the course.

Personally, I enjoy attempting to alter the code as my abilities improve, or otherwise add in my own personal stylistic changes to make it my own. Essentially, this repo should be viewed as proof of time and effort invested, and a relative skill-level/level of experience. 

The course can be found on Udemy.com with the title: 
"Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games"

Progress to this point:

+ NEED TO OPEN VS CODE THROUGH THE VISUAL STUDIO COMMUNITY 2019
DEVELOPER CONSOLE WITH COMMAND 'code' OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT COMPILE.
+ Finally had a real life example of the difference between 'compiled at runtime' and 'compiled before runtime (i.e. JavaScript vs C++).
+ Learned about Preprocessor Directives.
+ Learned about Namespaces and the standard namespace.
+ Can output text with 'cout'.
+ Can have basic formatting of text with 'std::endl;'
+ Learned that Unreal Engine 4 (4.22.X) uses UpperCamelCase for nameing conventions. Also not allowed to use '-' or '_' in names.

= The program is outputting text, and providing the sum and product of three integer variables.
